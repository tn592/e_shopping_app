# 🛍️ E-Shopping App (OOP Practice)

## 📘 Overview
This is a **console-based e-commerce application** developed in **Python** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It allows **customers** to browse and purchase products, and **sellers** to add and manage their listings.

This project was built as a hands-on exercise to strengthen understanding of core OOP concepts such as **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **composition**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The task was to create an e-shopping application using OOP where:
- 🧑‍💻 Customers can create new accounts using email and password  
- 🛒 Sellers can create new accounts and publish products for sale  
- 👀 Customers can view all available products and place orders  
- 📦 The system monitors product stock and hides out-of-stock items  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Seller Management:** Add, view, and remove products  
- **Customer Operations:** View products, add items to cart, and complete purchases  
- **Stock Monitoring:** Automatically adjusts product quantities and hides unavailable items  
- **Cart System:** Tracks selected items and calculates total price  
- **Modular Design:** Organized into multiple classes and files following OOP principles

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied
- **Abstraction:** Common user attributes are defined in an abstract `User` class  
- **Encapsulation:** Each class manages its own state and behavior  
- **Inheritance:** `Customer` and `Seller` extend from `User`  
- **Composition:**  
  - A `Shop` contains a collection of `Product` objects  
  - A `Customer` owns an `Order` representing their cart
