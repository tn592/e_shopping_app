# 🛍️ E-Shopping App (OOP Practice)

## 📘 Overview
This is a simple **console-based e-commerce application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.  
It allows **Customers** to browse and purchase products, and **Sellers** to add and manage their products.

This project demonstrates key OOP concepts such as:
- 🧩 **Encapsulation**
- 🧠 **Abstraction**
- 🏗️ **Inheritance**
- ⚙️ **Composition**

## 🧩 Class Structure

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **main.py** | Entry point of the app. Handles menu navigation for seller and customer. |
| **users.py** | Contains abstract `User` class and its subclasses `Customer` and `Seller`. |
| **product.py** | Defines `Product` (collection) and `ProductItem` (single item). |
| **orders.py** | Manages the `Order` class for customer cart functionality. |
| **shop.py** | Represents the shop that contains all available products. |

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Abstraction:** `User` is an abstract base class for both `Customer` and `Seller`.  
- **Encapsulation:** Each class manages its own data and methods.  
- **Composition:**  
  - `Shop` has a `Product` list.  
  - `Customer` has an `Order`.  
- **Polymorphism (ready for extension):** Both `Customer` and `Seller` inherit from `User`.
